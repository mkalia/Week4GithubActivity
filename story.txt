There once was a really long dragon that went through the skies at the speed of sound.
Without much of a warning, he would go down to the local markets and feast on apples.
One day, a brave challenger was attempting to take a piece of the dragon's scale while he was eating an apple.
The challenger was burnt to a crisp and his ashes were taken to the city's central river.

“Foolish humans!” the great dragon bellowed “No one can defeat me! Your sweet apple supply will forever be mine!” 
As the city gathered in front of the river to scatter the challenger’s ashes, the town’s mayor bitterly said “We cannot 
let this go on anymore, Appletown has always been known for its extraordinarily delicious apples. If we let this dragon continue 
to terrorize our town, we will have no more apple pies, apple tarts, apple jams, apple juice, candy apples, and caramel apples. 
Something must be done!” So, the entire city gathered to devise a plan against the dragon. They decided the best way to stop 
this from happening is to bait the dragon with the delicious fruit that it so desperately craved.
